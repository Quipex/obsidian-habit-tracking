# Ideas to implement

- [ ] make a button template include all the possible settings to tweak the button in one go.
- [ ] create a group command template
- [ ] remove eagerScan from group. make it eager when needed (e.g. when the location is included).
- [ ] finish a readme. add a FAQ with an explanation on how to refresh the widget state (switching to another page)
- [ ] add testing step to the release workflow
- [ ] leave only reasonable bounds for the settings like cell size and gaps
